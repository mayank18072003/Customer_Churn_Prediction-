## 📝 Description

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based solution to predict customer churn in a telecom company. By analyzing customer demographics, service usage, contract details, and other behavioral data, the model helps identify customers who are most likely to leave the service. The insights generated through this model can assist businesses in designing proactive retention strategies, improving customer satisfaction, and reducing revenue loss.

The notebook walks through the end-to-end process:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training with several classification algorithms
- Performance comparison
- Final model selection and prediction

## 📈 Conclusion

The Customer Churn Prediction model developed in this project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively used to tackle real-world business problems. After rigorous analysis and model evaluation, the Random Forest Classifier was found to deliver the best performance, balancing both accuracy and interpretability.

#Key findings:

-Contract type, tenure, monthly charges, and add-on services were strong predictors of churn.
-Customers with monthly contracts and no additional support services had the highest churn rates.
-Predictive modeling enables early identification of at-risk customers, allowing companies to implement targeted interventions and reduce churn.
